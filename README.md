# rv intro assignment: practicing with github

My goal with this class is to be able to learn and understand the basics of R. I hope to use this program to utilize data interpretation in the public health sector. Lastly, I hope to understand the capabilites/possibilites of analyses that can be done with R.

This is a change that I added to the testing branch.

Reproducibility is important to me because in the future, if I am able to conduct research on my own, I would hope to be able to refer to my past data and experiemntal procedures and actually be confident in the fact that a certain procedure works. I would also hope to be confident in other researcher's experimentation and analyses to be able to build off those ideas, knowing their research is reproducible.

This is my (cate's) change!
